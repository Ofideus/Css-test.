# Test


Contains exploration, tested Html and css styling effects currently used on developing www.eavent.no and client's frontend pages. 
- Hover over effects, sticky effects etc. 
- Parallax effect and more will be added later 


- Html newsletter to design own newsletters without the used of mailchimp - The newsletters are also compatible for different e-mail browsers/applications and shows accordingly. Newsletter.html is the most basic of the two.


I am open for better, all browsers friendly and break proof ways of writing any of the codes displayed/used in this repository.
